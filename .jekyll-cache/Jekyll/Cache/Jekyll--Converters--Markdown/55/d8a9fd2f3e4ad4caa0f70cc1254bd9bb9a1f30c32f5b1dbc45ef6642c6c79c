<p>To check if CLI is installed on your device properly, open terminal ( In Windows press WIN+R and then type ‚Äòcmd‚Äô without quotes and press enter  AND In Mac just press Control + Option + Shift + T).</p>

<p>Now we will log into an organisation using the terminal commands. For this copy and paste this command in your terminal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>sfdx force:auth:web:login ( To log into developer edition org or Production )</li>
  <li>sfdx force:auth:web:login ‚Äìinstanceurl ‚Äúhttps://test.salesforce.com‚Äù ( To log into Sandbox )</li>
  <li>sfdx force:auth:web:login ‚Äìinstanceurl ‚Äúhttps://customUrl‚Äù ( To log in with Custom url )</li>
</ul>

<p>After pasting this command press enter and wait for a second. After a few seconds you‚Äôll see that your browser is opened with the Salesforce login tab. Type your credentials here and click on login button.</p>

<p>When your org is fully opened go back to the terminal, there you can see that a message showing that the org is authorize.</p>
